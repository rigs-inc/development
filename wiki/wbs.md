# Create a Work Breakdown Structure

A WBS is a method that breaks a project down into a hierarchy of deliverables, tasks, and subtasks. It’s a helpful tool that defines a detailed cost or time estimate and provides guidance for schedule development and control.  You should be able to take a top-down look at your project and break it into the tasks and subtasks that will get you to completion. By breaking your project down into tasks, you’ll find that you can start to see the forest through the trees. It’s a simple, yet methodical way of organizing and understanding your project scope in smaller, manageable components.

Let’s walk through a process that will help ensure a solid, workable estimate.

## Step 1: List High-level Deliverables

First, sit down with your team and list out what will need to be delivered in order to meet your project’s end goal. For instance, if you are building a new website, you might deliver:

* Sitemap
* Wireframes
* Page designs
* Front end code
* Back end code

Make sure you’re being very inclusive of all tasks, and that you’re not leaving anything out. Ask your self **Which components conform the implementation?**

## Step 2: Think About Tasks

Once you’ve identified the high level deliverables for your project, you’re going to take a deeper look into what actually needs to be done within each one of them individually. 

As you dig into the high level deliverables, you should discuss (or ask yourself):


**What needs to be done to create this deliverable?**

Describe each tasks that needs to be perform to delivery the finale product.

**What other related project tasks will contribute to successfully completing this deliverable?**

Define which other projects might be a helper or blocker for the project delivery.

**What are the requirements of the tasks?**

Define each requirement needed for the project.

**Are we cutting any corners here?**

Make sure you list everything and anything—don’t cheat yourself!

## Step 3: Get Granular

That’s right: you want to make your WBS as detailed as possible. The only way to do that is to examine every step that you’ve identified and list out tasks. It’s all about elaborating effort and determining the work that will need to be done in order to successfully complete the deliverable

## Step 4: Format and Estimate

Traditionally, you’ll find that Work Breakdown Structures are presented in flow charts that resemble website sitemaps. That format happens to work very well because it shows a hierarchy of tasks and is easily numbered and referred back to. But, some people like to list them out on whiteboards or put them in spreadsheets. The format isn’t what matters here—it’s the completeness and accuracy of the tasks included. You can create your WBS in any format that makes you comfortable.
